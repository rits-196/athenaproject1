My project is a website on birds called animals!There is a interactive quiz included at the end to test what knowledge you have gained.I have made my project on birds because i love animals and wanted to spread knowledge on birds as i feel they are less associated with typical animals that come to mind.I made my prject using css,html and java script. I used java script for the backround of my main website and for the quiz (counting how many questions the user got right, writing the questions up, using GIFS).I used html for the basic body of the quiz and the main website and i used css for font sizes,colours and the overal design.
